# Timbre: Music Education through Science and Math

## About

Timbre is a video game created by **Celeste Roselli**, a 16-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia

Timbre's goal is to teach both STEM *and* music education in an interdisciplinary video game. 

## Research

Timbre uses a custom FFT algorithm to extract frequency and pitch data for notes and chords, and a custom rhythm detection algorithm to extract
percussive input. The game is controlled not only by character movement, but by musical user-input; the player controls the world around
them by singing and playing.
