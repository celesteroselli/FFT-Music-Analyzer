# Timbre: Music Education through Science and Math

## About

Timbre is a video game created by **Celeste Roselli**, a 16-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia

Timbre's goal is to teach both STEM *and* music education in an interdisciplinary video game. 

## Research

Timbre uses a custom FFT algorithm to extract frequency and pitch data for notes and chords, and a custom rhythm detection algorithm to extract
percussive input. The game is controlled not only by character movement, but by musical user-input; the player controls the world around
them by singing and playing.

For more info on the research that went into Timbre, check out my [research poster](https://hc-cdn.hel1.your-objectstorage.com/s/v3/614cdba2599566eab4354aaae6cd2d573c14e6da_compsci_vitatoe_roselli2__1_.pdf) and [research paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSJro_KroUMrk0QzwwhUP3pe8Exm6svfWcuGKwDSzXVyHocRFlZyQRUSXzv7sJMs87Uv5asunnRG2Z0/pub) which was presented at the Governor's Honors Program
