# What is a major triad?

Another way to look at this is by stacking major thirds and minor thirds on top of each other. For example, if you take your base note - let’s start with C - and find the note that’s a major third above that, you’ll find E. If you then find the note that is a minor third above E, you’ll find G. 

If you notice, G is also the same thing as a perfect 5th above C! You’ve just made your first major triad.
