# What are time signatures?

In music, in order to keep a steady beat throughout songs, songs and melodies are broken up into sections called “measures” in which each measure has the same number of beats or emphasized notes. It’s like a heartbeat keeping time.

When you read music, the time signature tells you what beat you’re singing. The number on top is how many beats are in each measure. The number on bottom is what type of note that beat gets.
