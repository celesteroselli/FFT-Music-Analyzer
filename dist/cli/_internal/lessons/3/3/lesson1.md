# What are mixed beat divisions?

You can combine all of the notes we’ve talked about into one measure, instead of having to make every measure evenly spaced. 

You can have a quarter note on the first beat, then two eighth notes to take up the second beat, and then a half note to take up the last two beats! Any combination works, as long as every note takes up the number of beats that it’s allotted.
