# What are octaves?

The diagram from last lesson showed one octave of notes - i.e. all of the notes until the note names restart. 

Scientifically, an octave is the interval between notes that is exactly twice the frequency of one note to reach the other. At this point, we restart the musical scale. We’ll talk more about 

Octaves are often referred to as “the same note”, but at a higher or lower level.
