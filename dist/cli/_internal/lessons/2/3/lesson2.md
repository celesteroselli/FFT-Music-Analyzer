# What are minor intervals?

In this level, you’ll have to play the intervals of Minor 2nds (m2) and Minor 3rds (m3). An ascending minor second sounds like this:

A descending minor second sounds like this:

A major second interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 16:15 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 750hz and another sound at 800hz. A good melody to remember that includes a minor second is the first two notes of the “Jaws theme”. Dooooo do… doooooo do….. dooo doooo dooo dooo do do do do
