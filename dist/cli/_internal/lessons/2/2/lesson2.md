# What are major intervals?

In this level, you’ll have to play the intervals of Major 2nds (M2), Major 3rds (M3) and Major Sixths (M6). An ascending major second sounds like this:

A major second interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 9:8 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 800hz and another sound at 900hz. A good melody to remember that includes a major second is the first two notes of “Happy Birthday”
