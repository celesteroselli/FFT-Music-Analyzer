# What is harmony?

Harmony is the relationship between the notes at different frequencies. When the frequencies of notes are interval ratios of each other, we often interpret those harmonies as consonant or sounding “inherently pleasing”. When the frequencies of notes are not exact interval ratios of each other, or not close interval ratios, we often interpret those harmonies as dissonant or sounding “inherently displeasing.”
