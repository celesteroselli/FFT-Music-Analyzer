# How can we remember harder intervals?

An ascending minor second sounds like this:

A descending minor seventh sounds like this:

A minor seventh interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 9:5 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 500hz and another sound at 900hz. A good melody to remember that includes a minor second is the first two notes of "Somewhere" from West Side Story, on the words “there’s a place for us”. Listen to this interval many times to memorize it!
