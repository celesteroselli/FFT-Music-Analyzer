# How can we remember harder intervals?

In this level, youâ€™ll help Si navigate the environment by singing the m7, M7, and m6 intervals. If the sign above the platform has an up arrow, sing the ascending interval from the starting note. If the sign above the platform has a down arrow, sing the descending interval from the starting note.
