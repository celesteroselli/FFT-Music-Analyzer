# How do we measure pitch?

As we know, pitch is the musical interpretation of frequency. Thus, to measure pitch, we use units of frequency - specifically Hertz (often abbreviated as Hz). 

Hertz is a unit for frequency, meaning that it represents how often something happens over a period of time. In this case, Hertz represents how often a sine wave does a full period (going from middle, to high, to middle, to low, to middle again).

Thus, higher frequencies on the Hertz scale represent higher pitches.
