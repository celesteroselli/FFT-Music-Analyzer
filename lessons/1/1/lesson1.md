# What is pitch?

First off, sound is simply vibrations of the air. These vibrations are periodic, meaning their high and low points repeat at a known rate, called a frequency.

In this gif, the “lines” are places where air is condensed, leading to high pressure. The “spaces” are places where air is less condensed, leading to low pressure. These areas of high and low pressure can be represented by a sine wave.
