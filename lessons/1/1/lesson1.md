# What is pitch?

First off, sound is simply vibrations of the air. These vibrations are periodic, meaning their high and low points repeat at a known rate, called a frequency.



In this gif, the “lines” are places where air is condensed, leading to high pressure. The “spaces” are places where air is less condensed, leading to low pressure. These areas of high and low pressure can be represented by a sine wave.

Pitch is the musical interpretation of the frequency of the note(s) you hear. A higher pitch means that the sound wave is travelling at a higher frequency, while a lower pitch means that the sound wave is travelling at a lower frequency. 

Thus, when you sing, hear, or play a higher pitch, you’re really just singing/hearing/playing a higher frequency of note, and vice-versa.

In this level, your goal is to help Si traverse the landscape by playing higher and lower frequencies that in turn adjust platforms to be higher or lower.
