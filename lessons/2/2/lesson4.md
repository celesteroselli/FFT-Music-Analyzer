A major sixth interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 5:3 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 300hz and another sound at 500hz. A good melody to remember that includes a major second is the first two notes in “dashing through the snow” in “Jingle Bells”
