A major third interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 5:4 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 400hz and another sound at 500hz. A good melody to remember that includes a major second is the first two notes of “When the Saints Come Marching In”
