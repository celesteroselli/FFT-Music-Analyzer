# What are minor intervals?

An ascending minor third sounds like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF5S4ZtzlTw

A descending minor third sounds like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF5S4ZtzlTw

A major second interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 6:5 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 500hz and another sound at 600hz. A good melody to remember that includes an ascending minor third is the first two notes of the melody “Greensleaves”, and a good melody that includes a descending minor third is the first two notes of “Hey Jude”.
