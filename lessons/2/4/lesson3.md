A major seventh interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 15:8 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 400hz and another sound at 750hz. A good melody to remember that includes a major seventh is the first two notes of “Take On Me”. You can also simply play an octave in your head, and then play one semitone below that.
