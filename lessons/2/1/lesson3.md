A perfect fifth interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 3:2 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 200hz and another sound at 300hz.

These intervals are called “perfect” because they do not have major/minor equivalents. We’ll discuss the science and math behind “major” and “minor” intervals in the next few lessons.
