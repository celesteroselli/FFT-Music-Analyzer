# How to turn a major triad into a minor triad?

We’re almost at the end of our journey! So I’m going to give you a little less instruction. You know how a minor triad is made; you swap out your second note in your chord for a minor third instead of a major third.

If the difference between a minor third and a major third is one semitone, all you need to do to convert your major triad to minor is to take the middle note and bring it down one semitone (aka one half step).
