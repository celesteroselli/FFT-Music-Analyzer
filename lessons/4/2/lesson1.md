# What is a minor triad?

If you watch this video again, you’ll notice that we build minor triads in a very similar way that we build major triads.

We still stack a perfect 5th on top of our base note, but instead of starting with the major third above our base note to get our first interval, we start with the minor third. Then, of course, if you were to stack a major third on top of that minor third, you’d reach the perfect fifth.
