# What are rests?

Rests are “pauses” we take while clapping rhythms. If you look at the third column in our diagram, the rest section shows us which rest corresponds to each note and beat value.

When you see a rest, treat it like you would any other note; it takes up the same amount of time/space in the measure. The only difference is that you stay silent. Don’t clap or play your instrument when you see a rest.
