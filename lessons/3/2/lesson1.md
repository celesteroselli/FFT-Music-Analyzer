# What are beat divisions?

Last lesson, we talked about time signatures, and how different rhythms can represent “the beat” in different time signatures. But what if you represent the same measure but with subdivisions of beats?

If you have a measure in 4:4, you could represent that with 1 whole note, two half notes, 4 quarter notes, 16 eighth notes, or 32 sixteenth notes.
