# How to turn a minor triad into a major triad?

This should be easy for you now! You know how a major triad is made; you swap out your second note in your chord for a major third instead of a minor third.

Again, if the difference between a minor third and a major third is one semitone, all you need to do to convert your minor triad to major is to take the middle note and bring it up one semitone (aka one half step).
