# What is a minor triad?

Thus, to sing a minor triad, you need to include your base note, the note that is a minor third above your base note, and the note that is a major third above that interval (aka the note that is a perfect fifth above your base note).

In this level, you’ll help Si cross caverns by building chord “bridges” across the base notes that are played. You must sing/play each note in the minor triad above that note to build a bridge.
