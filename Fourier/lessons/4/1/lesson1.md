# What is a major triad?

In Unit 2: Harmony, we learned about major and minor intervals. Specifically, we learned about major and minor thirds. Now, weâ€™re going to stack those intervals on top of each other to make chords, or collections of intervals played at the same time.

A major chord is usually made up with a major triad, which includes 3 notes: your base note, the note that is one major third above that base note, and the note that is one perfect fifth above that base note.
