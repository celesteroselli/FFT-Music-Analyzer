# What is pitch?

Pitch is the musical interpretation of the frequency of the note(s) you hear. A higher pitch means that the sound wave is travelling at a higher frequency, while a lower pitch means that the sound wave is travelling at a lower frequency. 

Thus, when you sing, hear, or play a higher pitch, youâ€™re really just singing/hearing/playing a higher frequency of note, and vice-versa.
