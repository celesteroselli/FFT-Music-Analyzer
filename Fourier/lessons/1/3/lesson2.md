# How are pitches represented on the keyboard?

When you press a note on the keyboard, a string inside of it vibrates. This causes the surrounding air to vibrate in a periodic sine wave.

Depending on the length of the string that the piano key presses, the air will vibrate at a specific Hz.

This, as we talked about last lesson, each note on the keyboard has a specific Hz value. The image below shows the notes from the A above middle C to the A an octave above that.
