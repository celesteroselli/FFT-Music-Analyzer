# How are pitches represented on the keyboard?

The piano keyboard, which follows the western diatonic scale, has 12 main notes. These notes repeat, just at higher and lower “levels” called octaves which we’ll talk about next lesson.

Musical notes go from A to G, and then repeat again at A. However, you’ll often see the keyboard starting at C, as the diatonic scale goes from C to B.
