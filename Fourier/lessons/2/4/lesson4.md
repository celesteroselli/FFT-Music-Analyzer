A minor sixth interval happens when the frequency of one vibration is at a 8:5 ratio to the frequency of another vibration. An example of this is if you were playing a sound at 500hz and another sound at 800hz. A good melody to remember that includes a minor sixth are the last two notes on “set the world on fire” from “We Are Young” by Fun. Listen to this interval many times to memorize it!
